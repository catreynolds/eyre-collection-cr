## About the Project

This project was curated by Catherine Reynolds, an MLIS candidate at the University of Iowa. The digital images that appear in this collection are believed to be in the public domain in accordance with the United States copyright law or CC licencing. If you believe any of the images in this collection are in violation of copyright or CC licensing, please contact the curator at catherine-reynolds@uiowa.edu.

 This project was born from the curator's love of 19th century gothic literature. This digital collection brings together fifteen different depictions of Jane Eyre and Mr. Rochester from the classic gothic romance, _Jane Eyre_ in the centuries following the story's publication. This includes illustrations and book covers from nine different editions of the novel, a play bill, a film poster, and photography of a contemporary ballet performance of Bronte's timeless work.
